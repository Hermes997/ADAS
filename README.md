The frame is low because the deep learning function is executed by the CPU. It is possible to improve the frame using GPU in the future.

This video is demonstrated mainly for function implementation, and there is room for improvement of interface design.

The program result was implemented as Python, and image processing, deep learning object detection, and MIL object tracking functions were used.
